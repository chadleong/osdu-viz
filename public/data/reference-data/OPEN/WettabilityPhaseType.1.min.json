This phase is generally characterized by a contact angle of less than 90 degrees with the rock surface, indicating a tendency to occupy the pores of the rock preferentially.","Code":"Wetting","Source":"Workbook ReferenceValues/Published/WettabilityPhaseType.1.xlsx; commit SHA 08e1c4c5.","CommitDate":"2025-02-09T17:44:00+00:00"}},{"id":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--WettabilityPhaseType:Nonwetting","kind":"osdu:wks:reference-data--WettabilityPhaseType:1.0.0","acl":{"owners":["{{DATA_OWNERS_GROUP}}"],"viewers":["{{DATA_VIEWERS_GROUP}}"]},"legal":{"legaltags":["{{LEGAL_TAG}}"],"otherRelevantDataCountries":["{{ISO_3166_ALPHA_2_CODE}}"]},"data":{"Name":"Non-Wetting","ID":"Nonwetting","Description":"The non-wetting phase is the fluid that does not spread on the rock surface and instead forms droplets or occupies larger pore spaces, typically due to higher surface tension with the solid.
