A set of two orthogonal polarization states are employed, being the most common the pair of horizontal and vertical polarizations. The most important property of polarimetry is that the polarimetric response to any polarization state of the incident wave of a given scatterer can be derived from the response to a pair of orthogonal polarization states. This SAR configuration exploits the fact that scatterers present different responses to different polarizations of the incident wave. For backscattering in which waves are transmitted and collected in the same position and by considering the reciprocity theorem, PolSAR leads to three-dimensional data. On the contrary, when scattered waves are collected in a different position with respect to the transmitted one, i.e. forward scattering, PolSAR data are four-dimensional data.","Code":"PolSAR","AttributionAuthority":"Ulaby and Elachi 1990","AttributionPublication":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10106049009354274?journalCode=tgei20","Source":"Workbook ReferenceValues/Published/InSARProcessingType.1.xlsx; commit SHA 56f7c736.","CommitDate":"2024-02-09T16:51:15+00:00"}},{"id":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--InSARProcessingType:PolInSAR","kind":"osdu:wks:reference-data--InSARProcessingType:1.0.0","acl":{"owners":["{{DATA_OWNERS_GROUP}}"],"viewers":["{{DATA_VIEWERS_GROUP}}"]},"legal":{"legaltags":["{{LEGAL_TAG}}"],"otherRelevantDataCountries":["{{ISO_3166_ALPHA_2_CODE}}"]},"data":{"Name":"Polarimetric SAR Interferometry  ","NameAlias":[{"AliasName":"PolInSAR"}],"Description":"This technique tries to combine both the advantages of InSAR and PolSAR. On the one hand, the introduction of interferometric diversity makes possible the data to be sensible to the structure of the target in the vertical dimension. On the other hand, the data are related to different scattering mechanisms in the same resolution cell, thanks to the polarimetric capabilities of the acquisition system. Hence, PolInSAR data are sensible to different scattering mechanisms in the same image pixel, located at different heights. The introduction of simple scattering models allows to extract relevant information about the scatterer under study. Among the possible applications of this technique, the most important is the extraction of parameters related to the vegetation cover which allow biomass estimation. In terms of data dimensionality, PolInSAR data consist of six-dimensional data if backscattering is considered, whereas they are eight-dimensional data for forward scattering.","Code":"PolInSAR","AttributionAuthority":"Cloude and Papathanassiou 1998","AttributionPublication":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/718859","Source":"Workbook ReferenceValues/Published/InSARProcessingType.1.xlsx; commit SHA 56f7c736.","CommitDate":"2024-02-09T16:51:15+00:00"}},{"id":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--InSARProcessingType:TomoSAR","kind":"osdu:wks:reference-data--InSARProcessingType:1.0.0","acl":{"owners":["{{DATA_OWNERS_GROUP}}"],"viewers":["{{DATA_VIEWERS_GROUP}}"]},"legal":{"legaltags":["{{LEGAL_TAG}}"],"otherRelevantDataCountries":["{{ISO_3166_ALPHA_2_CODE}}"]},"data":{"Name":"SAR Tomography ","NameAlias":[{"AliasName":"TomoSAR"}],"Description":"SAR tomography is a technique directed to achieve a real three-dimensional reconstruction of the scene under observation.
