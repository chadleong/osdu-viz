In many instances the deposition of fluvial sediments is strongly modified by marine forces such as waves, currents and tides, and depositional features found in deltas therefore display a high degree of variability. A delta should, by definition, prograde. They are typically classified according to the main control on deposition, which is a combination of river, wave, and tidal processes, depending on the strength of each. A significant deltaic accumulation necessarily requires the existence of a river system carrying substantial quantities of clastic sediment from an inland drainage basin to the coast, where the deposits form the delta plain or delta slope. All deltas have at least one common feature: a river supplying clastic sediment to the coast and adjacent shelf more rapidly than it can be dispersed by marine processes, and therefore a prograding sedimentary succession forms. A delta may be divided into a delta top, delta front, and prodelta. The delta top generally can be subdivided into upper and lower delta plain. The upper delta plain is existing above the area of significant tidal or marine influences. The lower delta plain lies within the realm of river-marine interaction and extends landward from the low-tide mark to the limit of tidal influence. The subaqueous part of the delta is called delta front and is that part of the delta lying below the low-tide water level. The delta front is most commonly characterized by a seaward fining of sediments, sands and coarser elastics being deposited near the river mouths and finer grained sediment dispersing farther seaward. The most distal part of the delta is called the prodelta, dominated by even finer sediments. As the delta prograde, a vertical profile will therefore show an upward coarsening trend.","Code":"Delta","AttributionAuthority":"OSDU","AttributionPublication":"2023","DepositionalGrossEnvironmentID":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--DepositionalGrossEnvironment:ClasticParalicShallowMarine:","Source":"Workbook ReferenceValues/Published/DepositionalEnvironment.1.xlsx; commit SHA 56f7c736.","CommitDate":"2024-02-09T16:51:15+00:00"}},{"id":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--DepositionalEnvironment:FluvioDeltaic","kind":"osdu:wks:reference-data--DepositionalEnvironment:1.0.0","acl":{"owners":["{{DATA_OWNERS_GROUP}}"],"viewers":["{{DATA_VIEWERS_GROUP}}"]},"legal":{"legaltags":["{{LEGAL_TAG}}"],"otherRelevantDataCountries":["{{ISO_3166_ALPHA_2_CODE}}"]},"data":{"Name":"FluvioDeltaic","NameAlias":[{"AliasName":"2110","AliasNameTypeID":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--AliasNameType:IntegerCode:"},{"AliasName":"Fluvio-deltaic","AliasNameTypeID":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--AliasNameType:IndustryCode:"}],"Description":"River dominated deltas are progradational shallow marine systems dominated by fluvial processes.

Within the estuary, the seaward portion of the valley is filled with marine sediments. Estuaries are fundamentally transgressive in nature. They are classified with two end members; tide-dominated estuary and storm-dominated estuary. In tide-dominated estuaries, the mouth of the estuary is kept open by strong tidal currents. The center of the estuary are dominated by sand-rich tidal channels and bars, whereas the margins tend to be muddy tidal flats. In wave-dominated estuaries, the mouth of the estuary is partly closed by a wave-generated barrier island. The estuary central basin is situated in area behind the barrier, and is commonly filled with fine-grained mud. At the head of the estuary, a bayhead delta forms. The base of estuaries are commonly marked by an erosional unconformity formed by fluvial erosion.

The minor fluvial influence does not generate a protruding delta and is often heavily modified the wave action. If the waves are able to redistribute the sediment supplied by the river more quickly than it is transported to the coastline, then the system can be said to have high wave effectiveness and low fluvial effectiveness. The determination of high versus low wave and fluvial effectiveness in the ancient relies on knowledge of the paleogeography of an area. If an area of coastline is open to a large body of water or an ocean, a high probability exists that it will have a high wave effectiveness. However, if a body of water is sheltered from oceanic waves by a headland, an island, or by rugose coastal morphology, then it may be considered to have a probability of high fluvial effectiveness and low wave effectiveness. If evidence for ancient rivers can be found in the rock record, then the area can be said to potentially have relatively high fluvial effectiveness. However, fluvial process dominance in these circumstances is not always the case as wave processes can still redistribute sediment supplied by the rivers, and hence waves can become the dominant depositional process. Alternatively, if paleogeographic information is available as to the size of the fluvial drainage areas, predictions of wave versus fluvial effectiveness can also be made on this basis.

They retain textural evidence of different but synchronous depositional settings,including mudﬂat, saltern, slope, and basin. The basin-wide model has its foundation on subsiding, attenuated crust. The accommodation space incorporated in this model is sufficient to explain many ancient, thick evaporites (500 m and more), in intracratonic basins or basins formed during the early stages of continental rifting. Water-brine depths  may be an order of magnitude greater those across platforms. Therefore, associated sedimentary facies will range from high energy shallow marine clastics, carbonates, and reworked evaporites, to slope and deep-basin mudrocks and redeposited coarse-grained sediments. There are no modern analogues for this type of basin; according to Warren (2016a) the Late Miocene (Messinian) Mediterranean drawdown is the latest example of basin-wide evaporites. Thick basin-wide deposits of gypsum and halite commonly act as detachments in thrust belts, and as halokinetic structures because of buoyancy contrasts with the surrounding strata.","Code":"SlopeAndBasinEvaporitesUndifferentiated","AttributionAuthority":"OSDU","AttributionPublication":"2023","DepositionalGrossEnvironmentID":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--DepositionalGrossEnvironment:EvaporiteSlopeAndBasin:","Source":"Workbook ReferenceValues/Published/DepositionalEnvironment.1.xlsx; commit SHA 56f7c736.","CommitDate":"2024-02-09T16:51:15+00:00"}},{"id":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--DepositionalEnvironment:SlopeEvaporites","kind":"osdu:wks:reference-data--DepositionalEnvironment:1.0.0","acl":{"owners":["{{DATA_OWNERS_GROUP}}"],"viewers":["{{DATA_VIEWERS_GROUP}}"]},"legal":{"legaltags":["{{LEGAL_TAG}}"],"otherRelevantDataCountries":["{{ISO_3166_ALPHA_2_CODE}}"]},"data":{"Name":"SlopeEvaporites","NameAlias":[{"AliasName":"9720","AliasNameTypeID":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--AliasNameType:IntegerCode:"},{"AliasName":"Slope evaporites","AliasNameTypeID":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--AliasNameType:IndustryCode:"}],"Description":"Basin evaporites deposited along a slope profile","Code":"SlopeEvaporites","AttributionAuthority":"OSDU","AttributionPublication":"2023","DepositionalGrossEnvironmentID":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--DepositionalGrossEnvironment:EvaporiteSlopeAndBasin:","Source":"Workbook ReferenceValues/Published/DepositionalEnvironment.1.xlsx; commit SHA 56f7c736.","CommitDate":"2024-02-09T16:51:15+00:00"}},{"id":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--DepositionalEnvironment:BasinalEvaporite","kind":"osdu:wks:reference-data--DepositionalEnvironment:1.0.0","acl":{"owners":["{{DATA_OWNERS_GROUP}}"],"viewers":["{{DATA_VIEWERS_GROUP}}"]},"legal":{"legaltags":["{{LEGAL_TAG}}"],"otherRelevantDataCountries":["{{ISO_3166_ALPHA_2_CODE}}"]},"data":{"Name":"BasinalEvaporite","NameAlias":[{"AliasName":"9730","AliasNameTypeID":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--AliasNameType:IntegerCode:"},{"AliasName":"Basinal evaporite","AliasNameTypeID":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--AliasNameType:IndustryCode:"}],"Description":"Basin evaporites deposited on the basin floor.
