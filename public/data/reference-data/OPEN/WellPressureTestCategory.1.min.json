During the testing period pressure, temperature, and fluid samples may be obtained so that an estimated 24-hour flow rate at standard conditions can be calculated. This theoretical volume will typically be used for hydrocarbon allocation and well surveillance purposes.\nThose tests can also be run as multi-point tests when the well is not shut-in, but it is flowed at many (unlimited) different rates to plot delta-p or delta-p-squared vs. rate.\nTests can be run either for water, gas and oil and can be used for integrity or well performance, damage","Code":"Flow_Test","AttributionAuthority":"OSDU","Source":"Workbook ReferenceValues/Authoring/WellPressureTestCategory.1.xlsx; commit SHA ad263a3e.","CommitDate":"2024-11-15T09:02:21+00:00"}},{"id":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--WellPressureTestCategory:Formation_Test","kind":"osdu:wks:reference-data--WellPressureTestCategory:1.0.0","acl":{"owners":["{{DATA_OWNERS_GROUP}}"],"viewers":["{{DATA_VIEWERS_GROUP}}"]},"legal":{"legaltags":["{{LEGAL_TAG}}"],"otherRelevantDataCountries":["{{ISO_3166_ALPHA_2_CODE}}"]},"data":{"Name":"Formation Test","Description":"Formation tests are used to evaluate possible producing zones encountered in a well. They are used to obtain fluid flow and reservoir pressure data. They are less expensive than DSTs. They are usually performed in a mud-filled open hole, after the total-depth is \nreached, but before running casing, on an electrical-conducting wireline test tool. They use a rubber packer seal, probe to go into formation, pressure builds up. These tests are repeated at successive locations providing a measure of reservoir pressure versus depth. Multiple zones can be tested on a single run into the hole. Types of tools used for formation test are formation tester, repeat formation tester, formation interval tester, modular formation dynamics tester, formation multi tester, and sequential formation tester tool. \nOptionally - the tests can be repeated among multiple runs - and is then called Repeated Formation Tests (RFT) and samples can be captured).\nUltimately, multiple samplings (multiple tools) can be made on a single wireline run for Modular Formation Dynamic Tests (MDT)","Code":"Formation_Test","AttributionAuthority":"OSDU","Source":"Workbook ReferenceValues/Authoring/WellPressureTestCategory.1.xlsx; commit SHA ad263a3e.","CommitDate":"2024-11-15T09:02:21+00:00"}},{"id":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--WellPressureTestCategory:Transient_Test","kind":"osdu:wks:reference-data--WellPressureTestCategory:1.0.0","acl":{"owners":["{{DATA_OWNERS_GROUP}}"],"viewers":["{{DATA_VIEWERS_GROUP}}"]},"legal":{"legaltags":["{{LEGAL_TAG}}"],"otherRelevantDataCountries":["{{ISO_3166_ALPHA_2_CODE}}"]},"data":{"Name":"Transient Test","Description":"Pressure transient tests usually involve changing the rate that formation fluids enter the borehole and recording the resulting downhole pressure versus time. These tests are carried out in a well for the purpose of deriving information about the characteristics of the earth surrounding the interval being tested. During this procedure, measurements are made relating to the production or injection of fluids from or into a well for a given length of time for an established set of conditions. These measurements are made to assist in the estimation or prediction of production or injection capability. A well transient pressure test usually consists of causing rate stabilisations and fluctuations in a controlled manner, including terminating flow, and monitoring the variation in pressures that result. These activities may occur in a single well or in multiple wells simultaneously. Furthermore, they are used to determine the effect that a change in pressure in one well may have on other wells in the same field.","Code":"Transient_Test","AttributionAuthority":"OSDU","Source":"Workbook ReferenceValues/Authoring/WellPressureTestCategory.1.xlsx; commit SHA ad263a3e.","CommitDate":"2024-11-15T09:02:21+00:00"}},{"id":"{{NAMESPACE}}:reference-data--WellPressureTestCategory:Transient_Interference_Test","kind":"osdu:wks:reference-data--WellPressureTestCategory:1.0.0","acl":{"owners":["{{DATA_OWNERS_GROUP}}"],"viewers":["{{DATA_VIEWERS_GROUP}}"]},"legal":{"legaltags":["{{LEGAL_TAG}}"],"otherRelevantDataCountries":["{{ISO_3166_ALPHA_2_CODE}}"]},"data":{"Name":"Transient Interference Test","Description":"Interference test are like buildup/drawdown tests. You change the pressure on one well in order to see what happens to another well. They measure the pressure variation with time recorded in observation wells resulting from changes in rates in production or injection wells. In commercially viable reservoirs, it usually takes considerable time for production at one well to measurably affect the pressure at an adjacent well. Consequently, interference testing has been uncommon because of the cost and the difficulty in maintaining fixed flow rates over an extended time period. With the increasing number of permanent gauge installations, interference testing may become more common than in the past.
